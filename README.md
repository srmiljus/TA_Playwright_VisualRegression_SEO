# 🎭 Playwright Visual & SEO Test Suite

This repository contains an end-to-end automated test suite written in **Playwright** with **TypeScript**.
The suite validates key user-facing functionality on a public marketing website(https://www.netlify.com), including:
- Newsletter form validation
- Sitemap and SEO checks
- Broken link (404) detection
- Pixel-by-pixel **visual validation** of error messages
- **Computed style comparison** of validation blocks (e.g., hidden vs. visible error messages)

All tests are fully integrated with **GitHub Actions CI**, and each pipeline run generates an HTML test report.

---

## ✨ Deliverables

- ✅ A complete Playwright test suite hosted in a public GitHub repository
- ✅ A comprehensive `README.md` with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Test execution instructions
  - Brief explanation of the testing approach
  - Assumptions and limitations
- ✅ A Playwright HTML report (generated locally and published via CI)
- ✅ GitHub Actions integration for automated test execution and reporting

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srmiljus/TA_Playwright_VisualRegression_SEO
   cd TA_Playwright_VisualRegression_SEO
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**  
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

---

## ▶️ Test Execution Instructions

- **Run all tests (locally)**  
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- **Run only non-visual (functional) tests**  
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep-invert @visual
  ```

- **Run only visual tests**  
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep @visual
  ```

- **Show the latest HTML test report locally**  
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report html-report
  ```

## 💡 Approach Explanation

This test suite uses:

- ✅ Functional validation of the newsletter subscription form (valid, invalid, and empty email inputs)
- ✅ SEO and sitemap checks to ensure key pages are indexed and crawlable
- ✅ Broken link detection, verifying no anchor links return 404 status
- ✅ Pixel-by-pixel visual comparison of validation messages using pixelmatch + sharp
- ✅ Computed style comparison of validation blocks (e.g., ensuring error messages are present in DOM but hidden via CSS when expected)
- ✅ Tag-based test grouping (e.g., @visual, @seo) for modular execution in CI pipelines
- ✅ Clean Page Object Model (POM) structure with reusable methods and locators
- ✅ Uses custom Playwright fixtures to inject page objects (e.g., HomePage, ThanksPage), replacing manual initialization in each test

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations

- Visual comparison assumes consistent UI layout – minor UI shifts may fail tests
- Only desktop Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit are tested
- Mobile or responsive views are currently excluded
- Sitemap test checks the first 10 URLs to balance speed and coverage

---

## 🤖 CI/CD Integration

This project includes full **GitHub Actions** CI integration:

- ✅ Runs on every push or pull request to main or master
- ✅ Supports manual test selection via GitHub Actions (Run workflow):
→ run all tests, non-visual only, or visual-only based on tag
- ✅ Automatically installs dependencies and Playwright browsers
- ✅ Publishes Playwright HTML report as an artifact after each run

> Workflow file: `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`

---

## 📊 Test Report

The Playwright HTML report is:

- Automatically generated after every test run
- Published as an artifact in GitHub Actions
- Viewable locally by running:
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report
  ```
